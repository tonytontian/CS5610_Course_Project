# Project Description

## Topic/domain
Movies

## Problem statement
People don't know what the best movies are based on their interests. They want a better way to find a movie that they will like given the movies that experts recommend.

## Target audience
The target audience is people who like movies but aren't very decisive and need some help picking them out.

## Solution proposal
Our solution will support two types of users: Movie-Goers and Critics. Movie-Goers are individuals that are trying to pick out movies to see. Critics are experts that provide recommendations and ratings of movies for Movie-Goers.

Movie-Goers can:
- Search for movie titles
- See the highest rated movies at a given point
- View details about each movie
- Rate a movie
- Leave a comment about a movie
- Like or dislike a movie
- Follow a critic 

Critics can:
- Do everything movie-goers can do 
- Provide a formal critique of a movie (may include ratings, and written commentary)
- Create a list of their recommended movies
- Send a post or update to their followers
